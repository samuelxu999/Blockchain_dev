# Sample truffle Project for learning process

This project demonstrates a basic smart contract use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
node install								// install dependencies
truffle compile								// compile contracts
truffle migrate --reset						// deploy contracts on local network
truffle test								// execute unit test cases
node scripts/token_demo.js 1 node1_0		// execute demo test cases
```
